# MadTest02

This is a try to implement such common task as displaying a collection of items in a RecyclerView
using Rx with additional goodies such as few itemView types, infinite scrolling, unified and easy
management.

1) I am starting from a simple implementation of RecyclerView with basic support for clicks because in
this simple case there is no place to use Rx, as I believe. It will be a good starting point for further
explorations and comparisons. Also, obviously some of classes created here will be reused on the next
stages.
