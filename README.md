This is a try to implement such common task as displaying a collection of items in a RecyclerView
using Rx with additional goodies such as few item view types, infinite scrolling, unified and easy
management.

1) I am starting from implementation of simple RecyclerView with infinite scrolling and support for
few view item types without Rx or any other modern stuff. Just plain and straightforward implementation.
